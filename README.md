## Known Limitations

### Technical Constraints

**Memory Limitations**: The application is constrained by browser memory limits. Very large PDF files (>100MB) or documents with hundreds of pages may cause performance issues or crashes. This is inherent to client-side processing.

**Pen Path Complexity**: Freehand pen annotations are not converted to vector paths in the exported PDF. Instead, they are rendered as bitmap images, which may result in larger file sizes and potential quality loss at high zoom levels.

**Form Field Support**: While the application can display existing PDF form fields, it does not currently support editing or filling form fields. This functionality was identified as a complex feature requiring significant additional development.

**OCR Capabilities**: The application does not include Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality. Text within images or scanned documents cannot be extracted or made searchable.

**Advanced PDF Features**: Complex PDF features such as layers, 3D content, multimedia elements, and advanced security features are not supported. The application focuses on basic viewing and annotation functionality.

### Browser Compatibility

**Modern Browser Requirement**: The application requires a modern web browser with support for ES6+ JavaScript features, Canvas API, and File API. Internet Explorer is not supported.

**Mobile Limitations**: While the application works on mobile devices, the user experience is optimized for desktop use. Complex editing tasks may be challenging on small screens.

**File System Access**: Due to browser security restrictions, the application cannot directly save files to specific locations. All exports go to the browser's default download folder.

### Performance Considerations

**Large File Handling**: Processing time increases significantly with file size. Documents over 50MB may take several seconds to load and render.

**Memory Usage**: Each loaded page consumes browser memory. Users should close other browser tabs when working with large documents to prevent memory issues.

**Rendering Speed**: Page rendering speed depends on document complexity and device performance. Documents with many images or complex graphics will render more slowly.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

**Advanced Form Support**: Full support for PDF form fields including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus. This would enable users to fill out PDF forms directly in the browser.

**Vector Pen Tool**: Convert freehand pen strokes to vector paths for better quality and smaller file sizes in exported PDFs. This would require implementing path simplification algorithms.

**Text Editing**: Direct editing of existing PDF text content, including font changes, text reflow, and paragraph formatting. This is technically challenging due to PDF structure complexity.

**Layer Management**: Support for PDF layers, allowing users to organize annotations into different layers that can be shown/hidden independently.

**Collaboration Features**: Real-time collaborative editing capabilities, allowing multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.

### Technical Improvements

**Performance Optimization**: Implement virtual scrolling for documents with many pages, lazy loading of page content, and Web Workers for background processing to improve performance with large documents.

**Advanced Export Options**: Additional export formats (PNG, JPEG for individual pages), password protection for exported PDFs, and digital signature support.

**Cloud Integration**: Optional integration with cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) for seamless file access across devices while maintaining privacy.

**Accessibility Enhancements**: Improved screen reader support, high contrast mode, keyboard-only navigation, and voice control integration.

**Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile interface with gesture-based navigation, improved touch precision for annotations, and offline caching for better performance.

### Advanced Features

**OCR Integration**: Client-side OCR processing to make scanned documents searchable and editable. This would require integrating libraries like Tesseract.js.

**Template System**: Pre-built annotation templates for common use cases like document review, form creation, and markup standards.

**Batch Processing**: Ability to apply the same annotations or operations to multiple PDF files simultaneously.

**Advanced Security**: Client-side encryption for sensitive documents, secure sharing links, and audit trails for document changes.

**Plugin Architecture**: Extensible plugin system allowing developers to add custom tools and functionality without modifying the core application.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

The application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 without any external frameworks or dependencies beyond the PDF processing libraries. This ensures maximum compatibility and minimal load times.

**PDF.js**: Mozilla's PDF.js library handles PDF parsing and rendering. It provides robust support for various PDF features and ensures consistent rendering across different browsers.

**PDF-lib**: The PDF-lib library enables PDF creation and modification. It allows the application to embed annotations directly into the PDF structure for permanent integration.

**Canvas API**: HTML5 Canvas elements are used for both PDF rendering and annotation overlay. This provides hardware-accelerated graphics performance and precise drawing capabilities.

### Security and Privacy

**No Server Communication**: The application operates entirely within the browser. No PDF content, annotations, or user data is ever transmitted to external servers.

**Local Processing**: All PDF processing, rendering, and annotation operations occur locally on the user's device, ensuring complete privacy and security.

**No Telemetry**: The application does not collect any usage statistics, analytics, or user behavior data. It respects user privacy completely.

**Open Source**: The complete source code is available for inspection, ensuring transparency and allowing security audits by the community.
